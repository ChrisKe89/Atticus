# TODO Phase 0 — Baseline Verification

## Summary
- Parsed `TODO.md` to confirm remaining scope across eight phases.
- Attempted `make db.verify`; run blocked because `DATABASE_URL` is not configured in the current environment.
- Ran `make quality`; Ruff lint/format succeeded, but mypy failed due to an unused `type: ignore` in `ingest/parsers/xlsx.py`.

## Verification Details
| Command | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `make db.verify` | ❌ Failed | Missing `DATABASE_URL` environment variable. Needs local `.env` or injected secret before rerun. |
| `make quality` | ❌ Failed | `mypy` reported `ingest/parsers/xlsx.py:12: error: Unused "type: ignore" comment`. |

## Blockers & Follow-ups
- Provision a `.env` (or export `DATABASE_URL`) for future DB tasks, especially before Phase 1 seeding work.
- Address the stray `type: ignore` to restore `make quality` before landing feature work in Phase 1.

## Next Actions
1. Prepare deterministic glossary seed data and corresponding tests (Phase 1 deliverables).
2. Resolve the mypy unused `type: ignore` so quality gates pass.
3. Re-run `make db.verify` once database credentials are available.
