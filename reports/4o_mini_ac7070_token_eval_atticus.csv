only certain protocols (LPD, port 9100, SNMP, and HTTP) are supported on the secondary Ethernet, and some features such as Internet fax, IP fax, Mopria, Google Cloud Print, and certain scanning functions are not available on the secondary connection. Additionally, common settings are shared between the standard and secondary Ethernet connections, and some network settings cannot be separated between them (e.g., opening ports, reception memory, IPSec) [Secondary Ethernet Limitations].",,13,150,163,b8052cd5ea0941d583197c82e355295f,13,150
39,What limitations exist for banner printing on the Apeos C8180?,"Banner printing on the Apeos C8180 has several limitations:

1. **Feeding and Output**: Banner printing is only possible via the Multi Sheet Inserter tray. Feeding coated long papers from the Bypass tray may cause mis-feeding, so it is recommended to feed such paper one by one. Registration is not guaranteed for papers fed from the Bypass tray or for stock longer than 488 mm. Banner sheets less than 210 mm in width will not stack properly in the Long Catch Tray due to guide width limitations. The paper holding capacity for long sheets is not guaranteed, and it is recommended to remove sheets from the output tray as quickly as possible to avoid stacking issues.

2. **Paper Size and Capacity**: Supported banner sizes are up to 330 x 1300 mm. The Banner Print Extension Kit supports up to 150 sheets (82 gsm) for lengths 488.1–660 mm, 100 sheets for 660.1–729 mm, and only 10 sheets for 729.1–1300 mm. For long papers, the stacking capacity is significantly reduced, and manual removal is advised.

3. **Print Quality and Registration**: Long papers (greater than 488 mm) are less precise in registration, increasing the risk of image loss, skew, creasing, and wrinkling. There is also an increased risk of paper jams with longer sheets.

4. **Finishing Limitations**: Finishing features such as stapling, folding, punching, and trimming are not supported for long paper. Only basic stacking is available for banner prints.

5. **Productivity**: Printing long banners may reduce productivity due to the need for manual handling and increased risk of jams or misfeeds. The printer may also pause to make image quality adjustments, further affecting throughput.

6. **General Cautions**: The paper capacity for long sheets is not guaranteed, and the output stack may collapse if not managed. For best results, users should follow the recommended loading and removal procedures and be aware that banner printing is more prone to operational issues than standard printing tasks.

90,Can the Apeos C7070 connect to both wired and wireless networks simultaneously?,"Yes, the Apeos C7070 can connect to both wired and wireless networks simultaneously. This is possible through the use of the Wireless Network Kit (Dongle) for wireless connectivity and the standard Ethernet port for wired connections. Additionally, the device supports a Secondary Ethernet option, enabling two separate wired networks (e.g., private and public) to be connected at the same time. However, each connection method (wired, wireless, or secondary Ethernet) has its own limitations and supported features, so some functions may not be available on all networks concurrently (see ""Secondary Ethernet Limitations"" and ""Wireless Network Kit 2 (Dongle) Limitations"")​[context]​.",,16,136,152,863e184bfa714ff9b72312f083449cc0,16,136
91,What fax-transmission speeds are supported on the Apeos C7070?,"The Apeos C7070 supports fax transmission speeds ranging from 2.4 kbps up to 33.6 kbps, in accordance with the ITU-T G3 standard. The specific supported speeds are:

33.6, 31.2, 28.8, 26.4, 24.0, 21.6, 19.2, 16.8, 14.4, 12.0, 9.6, 7.2, 4.8, and 2.4 kbps (G3) [Context].",,15,122,137,411056c98be1443d8c4db0be309be388,15,122
92,What fax coding methods are supported by the Apeos C7070?,"The Apeos C7070 supports the following fax coding methods:

MH (Modified Huffman), MR (Modified Read), MMR (Modified Modified Read), and JBIG. These are the same coding methods as those used for the general fax function on this device (see ""Coding Method | Same as the fax function"" and ""Coding Method: MH, MR, MMR, JBIG"") in the provided context.",,14,84,98,b04e462e1d844b169a4fc709afc8576a,14,84
93,Which optional feature enables secure secondary-Ethernet connectivity on the Apeos C7070?,"The optional feature that enables secure secondary-Ethernet connectivity on the Apeos C7070 is the ""Secondary Ethernet Kit"" (EC104202). This kit allows two Ethernet networks (such as private and public) to be connected to a single device, supporting secure network segmentation for printing and device management. However, note that it has protocol and feature limitations, such as only supporting LPD, port 9100, SNMP, and HTTP, and does not support certain scan and cloud print functions (Context).",,18,103,121,3aca62b68ad9432caf24f578799570a1,18,103
