39,What limitations exist for banner printing on the Apeos C8180?,"Banner printing on the Apeos C8180 has several limitations:

1. **Tray and Feeding Restrictions**: Banner printing is only possible via the Multi Sheet Inserter tray. Feeding long coated papers from the Bypass tray may cause mis-feeding, so it is recommended to feed such papers one by one. The Bypass tray does not guarantee reliable feeding for multiple long sheets (over 488.1 mm) and registration is not guaranteed for stock longer than 488 mm or when using the Bypass tray. Banner sheets less than 210 mm in width will not stack properly in the Long Catch Tray due to guide width limitations.

2. **Paper Specifications**: Supported paper weights for banner printing are 52–220 gsm for uncoated paper and 106–220 gsm for coated paper. The maximum supported size is up to 330 x 1,300 mm.

3. **Output and Stacking**: The paper holding capacity for long sheets is not guaranteed, especially for sheets longer than 488 mm. For example, the Long Catch Tray can hold 100 sheets (82 gsm) for lengths 488.1–729 mm, but only 10 sheets for lengths 729.1–1,300 mm. Sheets longer than 488 mm are more prone to creasing, wrinkling, and jams, and must often be removed manually from the tray.

4. **Finishing Limitations**: Finishing features such as stapling, saddle stapling, folding, punching, two-sided trimming, and creasing are not supported for long banner paper. Only basic stacking is available.

5. **Print Quality and Registration**: Registration and image alignment are less precise on long papers compared to standard sizes. Paper skew and image loss may occur, especially if the image is close to the edge of the sheet.

6. **Productivity**: Printing long banners may reduce productivity, as the printer may pause for image quality adjustments or due to the need for manual handling of output.

7. **General Handling**: There is an increased risk of jams, misfeeds, and stacking issues with long sheets, especially if the paper is less than 210 mm wide or if the output tray is overloaded. Sheets should be removed promptly to avoid stacking problems.
