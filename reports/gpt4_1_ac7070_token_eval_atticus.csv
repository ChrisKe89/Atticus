39,What limitations exist for banner printing on the Apeos C8180?,"Banner printing on the Apeos C8180 has several limitations:

1. **Tray and Feeding Restrictions**: Banner printing is only possible via the Multi Sheet Inserter tray. Feeding coated long papers from the Bypass tray may cause mis-feeding, so it is recommended to feed such paper one by one. The Bypass tray does not guarantee reliable feeding for multiple sheets of long paper (length >488.1 mm) and registration is not guaranteed for stock longer than 488 mm or when using the Bypass tray [Context].

2. **Paper Specifications**: Supported banner sizes are up to 330 x 1300 mm. Paper weight ranges from 52 to 220 gsm for uncoated and 106 to 220 gsm for coated paper. Banner sheets less than 210 mm in width will not stack properly in the Long Catch Tray [Context].

3. **Output and Stacking**: The Long Catch Tray can hold up to 100 sheets for lengths 488.1–729 mm and only 10 sheets for 729.1–1300 mm (based on 82 gsm paper). The paper holding capacity for long sheets is not guaranteed, and users are advised to remove sheets promptly to avoid stacking issues [Context].

4. **Finishing Limitations**: Finishing features such as stapling, folding, punching, and trimming are not supported for long banner paper. Only basic output is available for banners [Context].

5. **Productivity and Quality**: There is an increased risk of paper jams, creasing, and wrinkling with sheets longer than 488 mm. Registration and image alignment are less precise on long sheets, and image losses may occur depending on image placement. Productivity may decrease due to the need for manual intervention and slower processing [Context].

6. **General Handling**: The Banner Print Extension Kit must be set up correctly, and the tray should be angled as specified.
