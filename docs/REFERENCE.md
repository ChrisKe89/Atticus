## How to Keep Docs Updated

- Add or update module headers and function/class docstrings in source files when behavior changes (Python docstrings, TypeScript JSDoc).
- Regenerate diagrams and reference data by re-running the autodoc workflow (phases 3â€“4) after modifying routes or architecture.
- Run formatting and linting (`npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, plus documentation linters) to validate documentation integrity before committing.
